# YieldNest - Zero Coupon bonds on Injective  

## Overview  

This smart contract implements a Fixed Rate Lending protocol.  
It allows users to: 
- Mint debt assets using their INJ tokens  
- Trade bonds on dedicated on-chain markets  
- Liquidate under-collaterized positions  
 
This protocol makes use of several Injective modules, such as the TokenFactory and Exchange modules.  

This is a submission for the [Injective Illuminate Hackathon.](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/illuminate/detail)  

This smart contract has been deployed to testnet along with a dedicated UI, [you can interact with it here](what_is_the_link)
